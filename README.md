# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of analysis
The purpose of this module was introduce us to matplotlib. To gain some experience with matplotlib, we were given the following scenario: we are a newly hired data analyst for a very successful ride-sharing app company. We are tasked by the company to analyze all the rideshare data from January to May of 2019 and create a visualization for the CEO. To accomplish this, we learned how to make each of the following kinds of charts using matplotlib:
- line
- bar
- scatter
- bubble
- pie
- box-and-whisker

Furthermore, we learned how to add and modify different chart features such  as error bars and legends. Additionally, we learned how to use Pandas, NumPy and SciPy statistics to calculate the mean, median and mode of the data.

Urban city types by far have greatest number of rides, drivers and fares. Thus, urban city types also had the cheapest fares per ride and per driver.
In constrast, rural city types have the lowest number of rides, drivers and fares. Thus, rural cities have the most expensive fares per ride and per driver.
Suburban city types have the median number of rides, drivers and fares, as well as the median fares per ride and per driver.
However, urban city types  have more rides and drivers than rural and suburban city types combined. The urban city type's fare is also greater than suburban and rural fares combined. The suburban city type's average fare per driver is more than tiwce that of the urban city's average fare per driver; and the rural city's more than 3 times that of the urban city's average fare per driver.
## Summary
*3 business recommendations to CEO for addressing disparities between city types*
