# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of analysis
The purpose of this module was introduce us to matplotlib. To gain some experience with matplotlib, we were given the following scenario: we are a newly hired data analyst for a very successful ride-sharing app company. We are tasked by the company to analyze all the rideshare data from January to May of 2019 and create a visualization for the CEO. To accomplish this, we learned how to make each of the following kinds of charts using matplotlib:
- line
- bar
- scatter
- bubble
- pie
- box-and-whisker

Furthermore, we learned how to add and modify different chart features such  as error bars and legends. Additionally, we learned how to use Pandas, NumPy and SciPy statistics to calculate the mean, median and mode of the data.

Urban city types by far have the greatest number of rides, drivers and fares. Thus, urban city types also have the cheapest fares per ride and per driver.
In contrast, rural city types have the lowest number of rides, drivers and fares. Thus, rural cities have the most expensive fares per ride and per driver.
Suburban city types have the median number of rides, drivers and fares, as well as the median fares per ride and per driver.
However, urban city types  have more rides and drivers than rural and suburban city types combined. The urban city type's fare is also greater than suburban and rural fares combined. The suburban city type's average fare per driver is more than twice that of the urban city's average fare per driver; and the rural city's more than 3 times that of the urban city's average fare per driver.
## Summary

There are three ideas I would offer to the CEO for addressing disparities between city types.
1. Offer PyBer drivers rewards for giving rides to people in suburban and rural city types. For example, partnering with a gas station chain to give PyBer drivers a discount on gas for driving a certain number of miles for PyBer. Alternatively, there could be something like a reward of a $100.00 - $200.00 coupon off of gas for the top 5-10 PyBer drivers who drive the most miles in a given time period.
2. Offer a reward system for riders. For example, when PyBer has driven a rider a certain number of miles, the rider gets one ride or a round-trip ride for free. Since suburban and particularly rural city types will reach this number of miles faster than urban city types, it may incentivize more people from suburban and rural cities to utilize PyBer's services.
3. Offer a membership program with semi-custom rewards for riders. For urban members, they receive rewards (for example, a free ride; or a coupon) for utilizing PyBer's services a certain number of times in a given time period. For rural and suburban members, they receive rewards for utilizing PyBer's services a certain number of miles in a given time period. In this way, not only are people from rural and suburban cities given incentive to utilize PyBer's services, but so are people from urban city types. In this way, PyBer's profits increase not only from more participation from rural and suburban cities, but *also* from urban cities. Thus, PyBer's profits increase more than if we were only incentivizing rural and suburban city types.
